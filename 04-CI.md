# Continuous Integration

We all love automation.
Let's automatically enforce that our documentation shell always be up-to-date.

To achieve it, we will host repository on GitHub.
Then we will add free CI system AppVeyor to run some automation on every commit.

## 1. Make a fork

1. Fork https://github.com/vors/psconfeu-2018-workshop to your github account.
2. Commit all your local work (`./docs` folder and changes in `.psm1` file) and push it to your fork.

*Note: if you need a refresher on using git and GitHub workflow, take time to go thru [this 10 minute tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). It will be important for the rest of this section.*

Check out how your markdown documentation looks on GitHub.
Send a pull request to one of the files in docs (could be a minor formatting change).
You can do it directly from the web UI - this is how people collaborating with you on the documentation will most likely do it.
Don't merge the pull request, keep it open.

## 2. appveyor.yml

Sign-in on https://ci.appveyor.com/ with your GitHub account.

Click "+ New Project" and add CI integration for your fork of `psconfeu-2018-workshop`.

Edit `appveyor.yml` file.
In `build_script` add a powershell snippet that creates external help in `en-US` folder.
In `test_script` add a powershell snippet that will make sure that `Update-MarkdownHelp` doesn't change markdown.
This is an equivalent of markdown being up-to-date!

## 3. Verify

Now push your changes for `appveyor.yml` to `master` branch.
Test the system by creating 2 pull requests:

1. One where you add a new parameter, but don't add appropriate documentation
2. Fix for the previous one where you add parameter and add the documentation for it.

Now that you know how to use platyPS, it could be **great time to onboard one of your projects**!
